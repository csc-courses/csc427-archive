    "Wall clock time does not allow us to know what will happen if the computing environment, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "A more durable answer to the question of the time required for the program is provided by\n",
    "the theory of _algorithmic efficiency_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic efficiency focuses not on the program, but the algorithm which solves the problem.\n",
    "The algorithm will be cast into code, and then the many factors (hardward, coding ability,\n",
    "operating system) will give a wall-clock time,\n",
    "but the fundamental speed will be set by the algorithmic efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be presented in a particular language, that is, it is already code. \n",
    "But often it is written in pseudo-code - a no-particular programming language that lets\n",
    "the writer skip over syntax issues and smaller, known, difficulties of data representation,\n",
    "to elucidate the logic of steps that will be taken to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also depends on the notion that the algorithm solves all instances from an infinite\n",
    "problem family. For instance, sorting numbers is the problem family. Sorting the\n",
    "four numbers, 7,10,9,3, is an instance of the problem. It is an instance of size 3, and \n",
    "we imagine that the more numbers in the instance, the longer it will take to sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the efficiency of an algorithm is a function for all natural numbers $n$ to a value $T(n)$.\n",
    "It is a promise that an problem of size $n$ will finish in no more than $T(n)$ basic steps. \n",
    "Each basic step is considerd a fixed time primitive, and includes such things are adding two numbers,\n",
    "comparing two numbers, retieveing and storing a number from RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we replace a specific function, such as $T(n)$, with a class of functions that includes\n",
    "$T(n)$, called $O(T(n))$, all of which we consider as having practically the same run time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere I have notes for this so-called [Big-Oh notation](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Workbook/algorithms/notes/bigoh.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Time Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big-Oh notation places algorithms into groups by algorithmic efficiceny. For several reasons, the\n",
    "collectin of all groups with run times $O(n^k)$ for any real $k$, is of interest. This is the \n",
    "Class of Polynomial Time algorithms can also known as the P-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The details of the computational model affect the accounting the calculates the efficiency of an algorithm. But not so much that an algorithm goes in or out of the entire class P because of these details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P-time algorithms are _effective_, meaning that the computation can be carried out with obtainable resource. It is not a pie-in-the-sky calcuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- P-time algorithms can be used as subroutines of other P-time algorithms, and the resulting composite will be a P-time algorithm. It's nice to be able to build algorithms on top of algorithms and if all the elements are effective, the composite is effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A linear time algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present the \"find maximum number in a list of numbers\" problem, and give \n",
    "an algorithm that solves the problem and that runs in time $O(n)$, for $n$ numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the actual function $T(n)$ is a member of the family of functions, $O(n)$.\n",
    "While this should be written $T(n)\\in O(n)$, it is written $T(n) = O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run time is proportional to input size. Intuitively, this means the algorithm looks at\n",
    "each input element and then comes to a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A quadraic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present the \"sort numbers in a list of numbers\" problem, and give\n",
    "a algorithm that solves the problem and runs in time $O(n^2)$, for $n$ numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the actual function $T(n)$ is a member of the family of functions, $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this means that the algorithm is prepared to make combinations of input elements,\n",
    "two at a time, and make a decision based on this combinations. In the case of sorting, it accounts\n",
    "for comparing each pair of numbers to decide relative placement in sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential Time Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This discusion is found in [Exponential Algorithms and the Class NP](https://github.com/burtr/Workbook/blob/master/fa-sim/exponential-alg-class-np.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also discuss the class NP in that note. NP and Exp-time algorithms are _not_ related in the same way as P and P-time algorithms are related. My organizing the topic as I have can be a bit misleading. As the note will explain, an NP problem may or may not be solvable by a P-time algorithm, but a solution to the problem can be _verified_ by a P-time algorithm. And hence (details are needed) can be solved by an Exp-time algorithm, in the worst case, by brute forcing through the problem space.\n",
