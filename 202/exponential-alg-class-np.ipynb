    "### The SAT problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We next look at exponential algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the problem of solving a general boolean formula. A boolean formula is a formula\n",
    "over the logical arithmetic of True and False values, with operatins AND, OR and NOT.\n",
    "A solution to a boolean formula is a setting of the variables in the formula to \n",
    "True or False so that the computed value of the formula is True. \n",
    "The values assigned is a called a _satisfying assignment_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very general problem, because a lot of stuff boils down to a boolean formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, SAT simplifies the ask in a way which is not essential by restricting the form of the formula.\n",
    "It must be in _Conjunctive Normal Form_ (CNF). A boolean formula has three operations, AND, OR and NOT. The\n",
    "AND is also called a conjunction and the OR is also called a disjunction. A disjunct is \n",
    "the OR of variables or NOT of a variable,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "A &=& a \\lor b \\lor \\neg c \\lor e \\\\\n",
    "B &=& c \\lor \\neg b \\lor a \\\\\n",
    "C &=& b \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Are disjunctions. To satisfy a disjunction, at least one variable be True, if the variable appears simply, \n",
    "or False, if the variable appears under a NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is called a clause. CNF is an AND of a bunch of clauses,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A \\land B \\land C  = (a \\lor b \\lor \\neg c \\lor e)\\land (c \\lor \\neg b \\lor a) \\land (b) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT problem has a simplification called the 3-SAT problem. A 3-SAT instance is a SAT instance,\n",
    "restricted to the case were every clause has exactly three varibles, nagated or non negated.\n",
    "An example 3-SAT formula is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a \\lor b \\lor \\neg c) \\land ( \\neg a \\lor e \\lor \\neg f) \\land ( f \\lor \\neg a \\lor c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula has satisfying assignment {a:True, f: False, c: True}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An algorithm solving the SAT problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very straight forward way for finding a solution to SAT or 3-SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a list of all the variables in the formula. Say there are $m$ variables.\n",
    "- There are $2^m$ ways of assigning True/False values to these $m$ variables.\n",
    "- Try each of these assignments one by one, evaluating the formula on that assignment.\n",
    "- If the formula evaluates true on that assignment, stop and return the conclusion\n",
    "  that the formula is satisfiable, and optionally, provide the satisfying assignment.\n",
    "- If after trying every possible assignment, none make the formula true (i.e. the  \n",
    "  SAT $(x)\\land(\\neg x)$), return False, that the formula is unsatisfiable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To evaluate the SAT, linear time is needed. Hence this algorithm runs in exponential time.\n",
    "It is called the _brute force_ solution because it just works its way through the solution\n",
    "space, without any refinement about the problem's details, until an answer is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "### The class NP\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT algorithm presented as had the following notable features,\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solution space was of exponential size in the problem size, and \n",
    "  could be effectively enumerated.\n",
    "- Each proposed solution was polynomial length in the problem size.\n",
    "- There is a P-time algorithm that can verify whether the candidate \n",
    "  solution is or is not a solution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These are the ingrediates that make the problem SAT in the class NP, the class of \n",
    "Non-deterministic polynomial time problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The class NP is the class of problems that may or may not be solved by a P-time\n",
    "algorithm, but a solution can be verified (and a non-solution rejected) in P-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nondeterminism\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason this class is of interest is that is continues the study of non-determinism\n",
    "that was a feature of both Regular Languages and Context Free Languages. Apply the\n",
    "_non-determinism patch_ (so to speak) to our Turing Machines, as we had to Finite Automata\n",
    "and Push Down Automata, gives a Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NTM). The class NP is eactly \n",
    "the languages accepted by an NTM in P-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to specify what P-time accepting means for an NTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a string in the language, an NTM that accepts that language must have a \n",
    "  polynomial length computation path that accepts the string. It only needs\n",
    "  one such path from among the possibly exponentially many computations possible on that string.\n",
    "  No mention is made how that path is selected. The computation is not effective.\n",
    "- Given a string not int he language, no computation path in the NTM accepts the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proofs and puzzles \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason is because NP represents a very natural model of computation and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most puzzles and proofs are NP like.\n",
    "The solution to a Sudoku puzzle is trivial to check, but it is all the fun to fine. Same with\n",
    "a jig-saw puzzle. Checking the solution it is immediate - does the assembled picture look \n",
    "like what is on the face of the box? Finding the solution is all the fun. At least for\n",
    "people that like that sort of thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the amount of fun by puzzle count is reminiscent of NP. A 1500 peice puzzle is much\n",
    "harder than three 500 pieces puzzles, as witnessed by the rating of puzzle's by age. \n",
    "The web says a 500 piece puzzle is appropriate around age 9. If you decide to save money,\n",
    "and instead of buying three 500 pieces puzzles for your 9 year old and instead get one \n",
    "1500 piece puzzle, you probably have an unwelcome gift on your hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prover-Verifier systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This model of computation and knowledge is formulized in Prover-Verifier systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that you wish to solve SAT, but you do not have exponential resources, you can ask\n",
    "and expert (the Prover) for the answer. However, it is not enough to just accept the\n",
    "expert's answer, because we have placed no contraints on the expert. There is not even\n",
    "a certificate of practice in SAT solving we can request. \n",
    "\n",
    "So upon receiveing the Provers answer, we pass it through our P-time verification program.\n",
    "If the answer verified (the Sudoku solution given is valid, the picture assembles correctly)\n",
    "we accept the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, nothing the expert can say will make us accept as satisfiable an unsatisfiable \n",
    "SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have then the assertions,\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a string is in the language, the Prover-Verifier system can identify it as being in the language.\n",
    "- If a string is not in the language, the Prover-Verifier systems will never identify it as being in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assertion says that the P-V systems is always _sound_ for the predicate. The first\n",
    "assertion says that the P-V system is _complete_ for the predicate.\n",
