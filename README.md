Years are the old numbering system, with the year number at the end of the academic year, and fall semester 1, spring semester 2 (summer semesters are 3 and 4).

For instance, the fall semester August 2022 until December 2022 (https://registrar.miami.edu/_assets/pdf/academic-calendar-fall-2022.pdf) is 231.
