    "### Class ChomskyNormal\n",
    "\n",
    "The class takes a grammar as a dictionary, with special requirements on the variables and terminals, and reduces it to Chomsky Normal Form.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several steps to the reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lifting the Start State:__ A new start state is created, with the rule new start reduces to original start. If the empty string is part of the language, this new start state is alone permitted an epsilon rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Epsilon removal:__ All epsilon rules are eliminated. If the rule \"E to :\" appears, it is removed, and all rules with E on the right-hand-side are adjusted. This might produce new epsilon rules, which are then iteratively removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Unit Rule removal:__ All unit rules are eliminated. If the rule \"A to B\" appears, it is removed, and for each unit rule \"B to C\" found, the rule rule \"A to C\" is added. This might create new unit rules, which are then iteratively removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Bring to Form:__ This consists of two sub-tasks. Given a rule \"A to u\", replace all terminals in u with a variable that reduces to that terminal, and if u is of length greater than two, use chaining variables to create a sequence of rules, each of length two, which exactly replicate the effect of u.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sipser carries out these steps in the order presented. However, this can lead to a CNF exponentially larger than the original grammar. We also present another order, that seems to lead to a CNF of size linear in the original grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition specification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNG is presented as a dictionary with,\n",
    "\n",
    "- key \"variables\", a list of variables\n",
    "- key \"terminals\", a list of terminals\n",
    "- key \"rules\", a dictionary of variable:list(strings of variables and terminals)\n",
    "- key \"start\", a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables and terminals are strings with these special rules, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The characters %, _ and : are reserved. \n",
    "2. The : character represents the empty string.\n",
    "3. They are either a single non-reserved character, or the _ character followed by a % enclosed character string of non-reserved characters, for example, <code>_%start%</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the additional rule, \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Strings of the second form, when the % enclosed string is all digits, is reserved.\n"
