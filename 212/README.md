## csc427: Theory of Computation
### Spring semester 2020-2021 (212 old/20211 new)

This is a first course in the theory of computation. The course is of a generally mathematical nature, however it requires no calculus, or other "normal" mathematics. It explores what is computation. This is presented by way of machine models, and also linguistic models. 

The course website is at https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/csc427.212.

I recommend that you create a directory csc427 on your computer. This will be where you work on your programs.

To get a copy of the problem set, get a fresh zip of the repo (the green Code button, option Download zip) 
and unpack it somewhere on your platform. 

Then copy the file or files into you csc427 directory.

To submit your work, attach the completed file to a email and send to the adress and with the subject line
as described in the class syllabus.

If you wish to clone, 

1. Create a directory that will contain your git repositories, cd ; mkdir my-gits 
2. cd to that directory and use "git clone https://github.com/csc-courses/csc427-212.git" 
3. Now that you have a cloned repo, keep it current with git pull.

If you do clone, you will still need a separate work directory. If you modify the cloned files, you 
might find it difficult to do a future git pull, as you might have conflicts.
